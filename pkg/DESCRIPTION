Title:  General solvers for the general Black-Scholes
        (Max-Fokker Planck) partial differential equation (PDE) 
        in a multi-dimensional setting with main application 
        in finance (option pricing).

Description: The main focus in this package is the solving of the 
        Black-Scholes (Max-Fokker Planck) PDE for financial contract 
        pricing. It offers a general script languages that describes 
        any financial contract in an efficient and unique way.
        These financial pricing problems can be in multi-dimensions, 
        for which we employ sparse grids with the combination 
        technique. These initial value parabolic problems require an 
        efficient linear solver, for which we developed a geometrical
        multigrid solver. 
        We tested this fitob package up to 12 dimensions, where 
        reasonable results were achieved only up to 5-8 
        dimensions (accuracy is problem dependent).
        Solving such convection-diffusion PDE in multi-dimensional
        setting could be beneficiary in other applications 
        (other than finance) as well.
        The actual version supports multi-threading parallelism.
